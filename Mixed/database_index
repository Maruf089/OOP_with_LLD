🏁 Quick Interview Answer

MySQL (InnoDB) uses a B+Tree for indexes.

The primary key index is a clustered B+Tree where leaf nodes store full row data.

Secondary indexes are non-clustered B+Trees where leaf nodes store the primary key as a pointer.

B+Trees are used because they minimize disk I/O by keeping the tree shallow and enabling fast range queries.



🔍 1. Data Storage Difference
B-Tree
Internal Node:
   [K1 | P1] [K2 | P2 | Data2] [K3 | P3 | Data3]


Data can appear in any node.

B+ Tree
Internal Node:
   [K1 | P1] [K2 | P2] [K3 | P3]

Leaf Node:
   [K1, Data1] - [K2, Data2] - [K3, Data3] (linked list)


Internal nodes = keys only

Leaf nodes = key + full row pointer

🔍 2. Performance Differences
✔️ Point Lookup

B-Tree may find data early → slightly faster.

B+ Tree always goes to leaf → consistent lookup time.

✔️ Range Scans

B+ Tree wins — massively.

Range query = traverse leaf linked list → O(k) for k results.

That’s why databases use B+ Trees




✅ B-Tree vs B+ Tree — Key Differences
Feature	        B-Tree	                                            B+ Tree
Data storage	Keys + data stored in both internal & leaf nodes	Keys stored in internal nodes, data only stored in leaf nodes
Search path	May end early in an internal node (faster)	            Must always go to leaf nodes (uniform search time)
Range queries	Slower (must traverse tree)	                        Very fast — leaves are linked in a linked list
