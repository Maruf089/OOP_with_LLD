I’m Md. Maruf Hasan, currently a Senior Software Engineer at Samsung R&D Institute Bangladesh.
I completed my B.Sc. in Computer Science & Engineering from CUET.

I specialize in backend engineering, reliable database design.
I have worked on large-scale backend and data-intensive systems —
including Docker, RabbitMQ, CDC pipelines, database replication etc

I heard, Pathao operates a large-scale microservice ecosystem, using Go for high performance and Kubernetes
for orchestration

- this is a modern engineering stack, and
- a high-impact platform

It will be a place where I can both contribute and grow.”
