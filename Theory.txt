Oriented : In this world oriented world meaning is based on scenario. like :
- Focus : career oriented
- Directional : east oriented
- Priority : Customer oriented
- Acts/behave : leader oriented

in OOP oriented refer to the Acts/Behave of objects.

- Objects have property and behaviors(methods).
- It only exposes behaviors.
- It contains data and behaviors in itself and adopts a data protection mechanism.

Four Principles of Object :
- Abstraction : Objects does not know how another object performs task internally
- Encapsulation : Objects doest not manipulation of data inside of it through protection mechanism
- Decomposition : A system can be decomposed to smaller objects
- Generalization : Some objects might have common behaviors

Real world scenario :
- Abstraction : Train ticket purchase process. We just stand in line and give money for ticket. Then we get the ticket for certain
destination. We don't know the process for ticket internal processing for make it happen.
- Encapsulation : Ticket purchasing room is locked for everyone. No one can enter. So whole process of purchasing ticket is encapsulated by the room.


Internal working not knowing , only behavior knows - Abstraction

- Encapsulation hides how data is stored.
- Abstraction hides how things work.
Encapsulation helps abstraction

When we imagine of an object, we have a blueprint in our brain. We crete object based on that blueprint.
This generic blueprint is called Class.
We create Class using prominent property and behavior of an object.

- Encapsulation provides security by hiding data
- same behavior but they do it differently -> Polymorphism
