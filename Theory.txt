Oriented : In this world oriented world meaning is based on scenario. like :
- Focus : career oriented
- Directional : east oriented
- Priority : Customer oriented
- Acts/behave : leader oriented

in OOP oriented refer to the Acts/Behave of objects.

- Objects have property and behaviors(methods).
- It only exposes behaviors.
- It contains data and behaviors in itself and adopts a data protection mechanism.

Four Principles of Object :
- Abstraction : Objects does not know how another object performs task internally
- Encapsulation : Objects doest not manipulation of data inside of it through protection mechanism
- Decomposition : A system can be decomposed to smaller objects
- Generalization : Some objects might have common behaviors ( interface

Real world scenario :
- Abstraction : Train ticket purchase process. We just stand in line and give money for ticket. Then we get the ticket for certain
destination. We don't know the process for ticket internal processing for make it happen.
- Encapsulation : Ticket purchasing room is locked for everyone. No one can enter. So whole process of purchasing ticket is encapsulated by the room.
- Polymorphism : Export can be done by several customer. By creating subtype of Customer class Polymorphism can be achieved.
Different customer implements the export() method of Interface Export.

Composition - room can't exist without home/hotel. If home destroyed, room is also destroyed

Account Class - name,id,password
Student Class - composed of account class
here, Student can't exist without Account info
This is a example of Composition

- Composition - One can't exist without another and is composed of another
in the above Student can't exist without Account and is composed of Account

- Aggregation - special type of aggregation ( one to many relationship ) : Library and Book
- Association - Two objects exist independently but they can interact ( many to many relationship ) : Course and Student




Internal working not knowing , only behavior knows - Abstraction

- Encapsulation hides how data is stored.
- Abstraction hides how things work.
Encapsulation helps abstraction

When we imagine of an object, we have a blueprint in our brain. We crete object based on that blueprint.
This generic blueprint is called Class.
We create Class using prominent property and behavior of an object.

- Encapsulation provides security by hiding data
- Polymorphism : same behavior but they do it differently

Polymorphism can be achieved by subtype polymorphism.

Class is a type. We create subtype for polymorphism.

- Inheritance is good and needed for template method pattern
- Inheritance is working fine when we need both hierarchical reuse of code and subtype polymorphism
When we need only one like hierarchical reuse of code or subtype polymorphism, Inheritance is not good. It will break.

// So new requirement/changes makes it hard to maintain. It does not gives flexibility.
1. Exception occur / new exception handling method needed
2. new requirement require lots of changes to make it works

that's why we should avoid inheritance.
We should use composition + interface over inheritance



Design a software at low level :
1. Gather requirement : User stories
2. Identify actor
3. Identify class and add property,behavior,relations
4. Apply decomposition and generalization - follow SOLID, DRY, KISS
5. Identify Service class
6. Apply Solid and Design Patterns


Funtional Programming easier.
OOP hard but maintenance easy, changes easy to absorb.
